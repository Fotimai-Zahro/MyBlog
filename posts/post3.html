            Computers usually do things that we are given specific instructions
            for adding, subtracting, storing information. But there are problems
            in life that cannot be solved by simple rules. For example,
            determining whether an email is spam or not, distinguishing a cat
            from a dog in a picture, or detecting diseases at an early stage. It
            is to solve such problems that the field of Machine Learning was
            needed.
          </p>

            Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that gives
            computers the ability to perform tasks by learning from data,
            instead of being explicitly programmed. In classical programming, a
            programmer writes each step by hand. In Machine Learning, a model
            sees thousands of examples and finds patterns on its own. Just like
            a child learns to distinguish "this is a dog, this is a cat" after
            hearing it many times.

            The history of Machine Learning dates back to the mid-20th century.
            The initial ideas came from research in statistics and artificial
            intelligence. In the 1950s, Alan Turing posed the question, "Can a
            machine think?" Later, neural networks, decision trees, and
            statistical models were developed. The real turning point came in
            the 2000s, when large amounts of data and powerful computers
            appeared, it was from that moment that Machine Learning began to
            produce practical results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, there are several main directions of Machine Learning. In
            Supervised Learning, a model learns from specified examples, for
            example, I used this method in my Titanic project to predict the
            survival of passengers. In Unsupervised Learning, a model finds
            groups on its own from unspecified data. In Reinforcement Learning,
            a model learns through interaction with the environment, using a
            system of rewards and punishments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine Learning is now embedded in many parts of our lives. Facial
            recognition on your phone, YouTube recommendations, early detection
            of diseases in medicine, increased productivity in agriculture - all
            these are practical results of ML. Most importantly, this field is
            still in its infancy - new discoveries and new methods are emerging
            every year. Therefore, studying ML is a very valuable investment not
            only for the present, but also for the future.
