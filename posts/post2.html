                <p>The biggest question for those who want to learn Machine Learning is often: "Where do I start?" I once searched for the answer to this very question. Today, I want to tell you openly about the platforms I've tried from resources that allow you to get started without technical knowledge to in-depth practice.</p>

                <p>I started my ML journey with the "AI for Beginners" course on the HP LIFE platform. This is a free platform provided by the HP Foundation and does not require any technical knowledge. The course covers the basic concepts of artificial intelligence, its business applications, the role of data, and ethical issues. It was this course that sparked my interest in ML and prompted me to study it in more depth.</p>

                <p>As my interest grew, I focused on the most important foundation of ML — mathematics. At this stage, I used both platforms in parallel.  I took the "Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra" course from Imperial College London on Coursera, and Robert Talbert's 27-hour "Linear Algebra" course on Cursa at the same time. Both courses cover vectors, matrices, and linear transformations, but each with its own unique style of explanation. Seeing the same topic from two different perspectives significantly deepened my understanding.</p>

                <p>I used two other platforms in parallel to combine theory with practice. I completed a free Python course on Kaggle and learned libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, the ability to work with real datasets is especially valuable here. And on DataCamp, I completed a 16-hour "Machine Learning Fundamentals in Python" course. This platform perfectly combines theory and practice, in each lesson you can practice by writing code directly in the browser. It was on the basis of this knowledge that I created my Titanic project.</p>

                <p>Online platforms are a great place to start learning ML, but that's just the beginning. It's important to keep learning to deepen your knowledge and apply it in practice. Online resources have shown me the way, and I continue to move forward on that path.</p>
