            When learning Machine Learning, you need a real-world project to put theory into practice. As my first project, I chose the Titanic dataset — a classic and convenient starting point for those just getting into ML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of the project was to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic based on their information (age, gender, ticket class, etc.). To do this, I built two classification models — Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, and compared them.
          </p>
          <p>The dataset consists of 8 columns about 887 passengers: survival status, ticket class, name, gender, age, number of relatives, and price paid. I first dug deep into the data. I found several interesting patterns: the overall survival rate was only 38.56%. The gender gap is huge — 74.20% of women survived, while only 19.02% of men survived.  Ticket class also played a significant role: 62.96% of 1st class passengers survived, 47.28% of 2nd class passengers survived, and 24.44% of 3rd class passengers survived.</p>
          <p>Before training the models, I processed the data. I converted the text values ​​in the gender column to numbers, created a new feature to calculate family size, and selected the 6 most important columns for the models: ticket class, gender, age, price, family size, and single status.</p>
          <p>
            I divided the data into 80% training and 20% test. The Logistic Regression model showed 76.40% accuracy. The Decision Tree model achieved 79.78% accuracy and was the winner. I visualized the results of both models using a confusion matrix and analyzed where they were making mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me not only how to write code, but also how to read data, make sense of it, and interpret the results. I also experienced the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). If you don't understand the data well before building a model, the results won't be accurate. 
          </p>
          <p>The project code is openly available on:</p>
