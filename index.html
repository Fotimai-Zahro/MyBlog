          <p class="post-excerpt">
            When learning Machine Learning, you need a real-world project to put
            theory into practice. As my first project, I chose the Titanic
            dataset — a classic and convenient starting point for those just
            getting into ML...

            The biggest question for those who want to learn Machine Learning is
            often: "Where do I start?" I once searched for the answer to this
            very question. Today, I want to tell you openly about the platforms
            I've tried from resources that allow you to get started without

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Computers usually do things that we are given specific instructions
            for adding, subtracting, storing information. But there are problems
            in life that cannot be solved by simple rules. For example,
            determining whether an email is spam or not, distinguishing a cat
            from a dog in a picture, or detecting diseases at an early stage. It
            is to solve such problems that the field of Machine Learning was
            needed....
